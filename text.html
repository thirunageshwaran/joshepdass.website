                    Even though India wonâ€™t participate in the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar towards the end of the year, the quadrennial showpiece will also hold considerable interest for Indian football fans.
            
                    Indian football, womenâ€™s football in particular, is looking forward to 2022 as a breakthrough year with the country hosting and competing in two major tournaments -  the AFC Women's Asian Cup in January and the FIFA Under-17 Womenâ€™s World Cup in October.
            
                    Badminton players will also be in focus in 2022 after PV Sindhuâ€™s bronze â€“ her second Olympic medal â€“ at Tokyo 2020 and Kidambi Srikanthâ€™s historic menâ€™s singles silver at the 2021 worlds.

                        The Witcher is a fantasy drama television series created by Lauren Schmidt Hissrich for Netflix. It is based on the book series of the same name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Set on a fictional, medieval-inspired landmass known as the Continent, The Witcher explores the legend of Geralt of Rivia, Yennefer of Vengerberg and Princess Ciri. It stars Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan.

The first season, consisting of eight episodes, was released on Netflix on December 20, 2019. It was based on The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, which are collections of short stories that precede the main The Witcher saga. The second season, also consisting of eight episodes and based on the novel Blood of Elves, released on December 17, 2021. In September 2021, Netflix renewed the series for a third season, which also consisted of eight episodes, released in two volumes on June 29 and July 27, 2023. This will be followed by a fourth season, with Liam Hemsworth taking over the role of Geralt of Rivia.

An animated origin story film, The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, was released on August 23, 2021. A prequel miniseries, The Witcher: Blood Origin, was released on December 25, 2022






The story begins with Geralt of Rivia, Crown Princess Ciri of Cintra, and the quarter-elf sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg at different points of time, exploring formative events that shape their characters throughout the first season, before eventually merging into a single timeline.

Geralt and Ciri are linked by destiny since before she was born when he unknowingly demanded her as a reward for his services by invoking "the Law of Surprise". After the two finally meet, Geralt becomes the princess's protector and must help her and fight against her various pursuers to prevent her Elder Blood and powerful magic from being used for malevolent purposes and keep Ciri and their world safe
